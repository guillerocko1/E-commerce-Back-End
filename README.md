# E-commerce-Back-End


## Summary

To build this application we need to use the MySQL2 Links to an external site and Sequelize Links to an external site packages  as well to connect the Express.js API to a MySQL database and the dotenv package Links to an external site to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like our MySQL username, password, and database name.

Use the schema.sql file in the db folder to create the database using MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data, like the MySQL username, password, and database name.

This application allows to the user to feed a Database running the seeds/index.js file and it can seen in MySql using the app MySQLWorkBench. After that the user can run each API to see the information in Insomnia.
